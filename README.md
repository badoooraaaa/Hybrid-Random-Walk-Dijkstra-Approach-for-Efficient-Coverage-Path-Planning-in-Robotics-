Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is crucial in robotics for tasks like 
environmental monitoring and search and rescue, demanding efficient area 
coverage while minimizing time and energy consumption. This paper presents a 
hybrid approach that integrates the exploration capabilities of the Random Walk 
algorithm with the optimal pathfinding of Dijkstra's algorithm to enhance CPP 
efficiency. Our method addresses the limitations of traditional CPP techniques 
by enabling robots to navigate complex environments with obstacles while 
minimizing redundant movements. The integration of Dijkstra's algorithm 
optimizes path segments between waypoints generated by the Random 
Algorithm, ensuring faster traversal times and reduced energy expenditure. This 
hybrid approach holds significant potential for enhancing the performance of 
robots in various applications requiring efficient and comprehensive area 
coverage. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach, revealing 
notable gains in coverage speed, workspace exploration, and pathfinding 
compared to the proposed Hybrid Approach.
